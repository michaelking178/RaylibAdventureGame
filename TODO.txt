TOP PRIORITY
- Draw BaseActors sorted by y-position
    - Collect all BaseActors into resizeable array in case I want to add new ones dynamically throughout the level.
    - Draw sort by y-position and draw in order
    - GameState could own this
- Tool
    - Sockets to Character
    - Anims are unique
    - Uses could include weapons, non-combat tools, puzzle items, etc.
    - Character rendering will have to sort character/tool based on DIRECTION (up == draw tool first, down == draw tool second)
- Collision
    - Player collision currently reliant on screenPos?
    - Enemies don't have any collision
- Separate player position from screenpos? Don't make so many things reliant on screenpos
- Convert ANIM_STATE to 2D array (DIRECTION, ACTION)
    - Only update direction when velocity != 0
    - Maybe don't bother with special idle states for now.

LOWER PRIORITY
- Input system
    - Create InputActions to abstract raw input from actions
    - Later, add remapping?
    - Raw input is built into raylib
- Levels
    - Add ability to switch levels
    - Save persistent data between levels
    - Pass data between levels?
- UI
    - Pause Menu
        - Resume
        - Exit Game
    - Inventory

NOTE: Raylib has a bunch of other libraries to explore: https://www.raylib.com/
